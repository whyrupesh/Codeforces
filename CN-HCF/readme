The Euclidean Algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The GCD of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, who described this algorithm in his Elements, a mathematical treatise written around 300 BCE.

The Euclidean Algorithm works as follows

1. Start with two positive integers, a and b, where a is greater than or equal to b.
2. Divide a by b, and find the remainder. Let r be the remainder.
3. Replace a with b, and b with r.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until b becomes 0.
5. When b becomes 0, the current value of a is the GCD of the original a and b.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the Euclidean Algorithm:

Let's find the GCD of 48 and 18

1. Start with a = 48 and b = 18.
2. Divide 48 by 18 -> 48 รท 18 = 2 with a remainder of 12 (r = 12).
3. Replace a with 18 and b with 12.
4. Divide 18 by 12 -> 18 รท 12 = 1 with a remainder of 6 (r = 6).
5. Replace a with 12 and b with 6.
6. Divide 12 by 6 -> 12 รท 6 = 2 with a remainder of 0 (r = 0).
7. Since b has become 0, we stop. The GCD is the current value of a, which is 6.

So, the GCD of 48 and 18 is 6.

The Euclidean Algorithm is an efficient and fundamental method for finding the GCD of two numbers, and it has many applications in mathematics and computer science, including simplifying fractions, solving modular arithmetic problems, and determining whether two numbers are coprime (having a GCD of 1).
